Known limitation in the current engine implementation
- `OptimizerService._normalize_df` builds a time index that includes both the start and end of the horizon, so `_to_array` produces a 2D array with `N+1` values. `ExternalContext.from_client` expects a 1D vector of length `N`, which causes a `DimensionNotRespected` error when using the service end-to-end. Minimal fix in `src`: flatten the production vector to 1D and trim it to `int(horizon_minutes / step_minutes)` (or relax `check_array` to accept `(1, N)` input). Tests that exercise `trajectory_of_client` monkeypatch `_to_array` to bypass this mismatch.
